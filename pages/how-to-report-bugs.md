How to Report Bugs
============================================================

While this may take longer than just sending a message to the developer saying "btw this is broken", looking into -- never mind fixing -- a bug can take an order of magnitude or two longer. Help us out and take a minute to save us 15m (cost of task-switching to look into something).

1. Make detailed instruction about exactly how to replicate the issue.
2. Test out the accuracy of your instructions by following then to the letter in a private|incognito tab.
3. Make detailed notes about the variables.
	* equipment you're on
	* browser you're using
	* where you are (ethernet here, wifi here, cell network, wifi at home, etc.)
	* when do you encounter the issue, when do you not?
4. Email it to Jame. He's our ~~Scrum Lord~~... ~~squelch filter~~... Project Manager. He'll duplicate the issue to verify that it should actually be passed to us, what the priority is, and who should be kept abreast of updates.

Basically the idea is to not distract us with things that we cannot actually fix because they are not actually broken. It's not that this is a common occurence, but it's the kind of workflow that works best for the work-management system we're developing. While it may seem wierd to do all these things, it will scale much better as we grow.

What to call customers in emails
------------------------------------------------

If we do **not** have **both** their first **and** last names, then don't use just one -- that would be weird -- use their display name.

If their display name is not set, use their email.

### Wordpress Dashboard Search will Troll You

Don't paste into search inputs in the Wordpress Admin area — for example the search on the "Posts" page. Sometime's you'll get some weird character encoding from whereever you copied|cut from — or something like that — and your search will falsey return no results. Such a situation will happen without your being aware of it and it will mess you right up.

To avoid this, just make a habit of typing instead of pasting. Or if you don't results and you think you should of —and you pasted the search term in— then try typing.
